  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm a backend-focused developer with a strong grasp of systems architecture,
     DevOps, and web technologies. From microservices and container orchestration to debugging complex Linux issues, 
     I thrive on solving real-world problems and building scalable, resilient systems. 
     I’m currently deepening my skills in Laravel and JavaScript while building practical projects like task management apps and refining my frontend abilities. 
     I bring a curious, growth-driven mindset to everything I do—always eager to learn, reflect, 
     and improve both technically and personally. Whether it's optimizing an API, mentoring a new team member, or just pushing past a difficult day with grit,
     I approach every challenge with persistence and purpose.</p>
